Pong Remake Game
Developed By: Dan10channel
Version: 2.0
Date Made: November, 19, 2016.

THIS IS THE FINAL STAGE IN THE GAME, DUE TO TECHNICAL REASONS. PLEASE READ THE UPDATE
SECTION TO LEARN MORE.

Description: This is the first game that I have ever made using Unity, so please don't 
expect it to be very good. The game I made is called "Pong". Pong is a classic game made 
in 1972. The game I made is not totally accurate to the oringinal game, so yeah. I don't 
think I have to explain much, it's just a simple game made in the 70's. Enjoy :D.

Update: For some reason I can't edit the project any more, it just loads up a white screen.
I'm afraid I cannot work on the game any more, this means that I am not able to add any
"Options" or "Multiplayer. I can no longer add features to the game. This means that this
is the final stage in the game, sorry. : (
