> A modern remake of the classic Pong game using Unity

## 📝 Description

This is my first game ever made using Unity! It's a remake of the classic game "Pong" from 1972. While not entirely accurate to the original, it captures the essence of this simple yet iconic game from the 70s.

Please note that this version may not be perfect, as it was my first attempt at game development with Unity. Enjoy the nostalgia and simplicity of Pong! 😄

## 🚀 Features

- Classic Pong gameplay
- Made with Unity
- Single-player mode

## ⚠️ Important Update

**This is the final version of the game due to technical limitations.**

Unfortunately, I can no longer edit the project as it now loads only a white screen when opened. This means:

- No further updates will be possible
- Planned features like "Options" and "Multiplayer" cannot be added
- The game is in its final state
